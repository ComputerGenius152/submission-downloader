# submission-downloader
Submission Downloader downloads your submissions in bulk from [DMOJ](https://dmoj.ca/). You can tell it to download all your submissions, all the correct ones, or the best submission from each question. This complements [dmoj-submission-downloader](https://github.com/Ninjaclasher/dmoj-submission-downloader), which downloads all the submissions for a problem. Although the code shares some similiarities with it, it was not originally forked from that repository.

## Getting Started

### Installing
This program can be installed in three ways. You can clone the repository and run the code yourself with Python, install this with pip, or download prebuilt binaries that will run without Python from our releases page.

### Usage
```Instructions coming soon```

## Todo
- Make the program
- Installing using pip and prebuilt binaries
